# CG_Assignment

The computer graphics (CG) mini project titled “Sailing Navy Warship” is project that is 
using a set of OpenGL functions to demonstrate how to build 2D model of objects and their 
movement and to demonstrate the day/night cycle of an environment along with a shooting 
mechanism for the ship. 

The project consists of 2 scenes. 
The first scene shows the project information such as project title, name of student, 
USN and so on. 

The second scene will be of the ship and its background sailing on the ocean with 
three planes flying across the screen. 
User interaction is provided by enabling the user to move the ship in forward and backward 
direction using the alphabetical keys. User can stop the ship and even choose the day and 
night cycle. 

During the day cycle the sun will be visible starting from the left position. As we slowly 
change to the night cycle the sun will move to the right until it disappears and the moon will 
appear in its place. All the 2D models in the program such as the ship and the mountains also 
changes color based on the day/night cycle 
Additionally a shooting mechanism is implemented for the ship with the user being able to 
fire one shot at a time using the alphabetical keys. 
The planes continuously travel across the screen automatically.
